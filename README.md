Future Interns Cyber Security Internship — Practical Submission Repository 🔐

Introduction:
This repository represents the practical submission and documented work completed during the Future Interns Cyber Security Internship Program. The internship was structured to focus on cybersecurity fundamentals, web vulnerability analysis, reconnaissance, OSINT, reporting methodology, tool-based workflows, and ethical assessment practices. The output in this repository reflects both technical execution and professional documentation standards expected in cyber security roles such as penetration testing, vulnerability research, security analysis, and red teaming.

Intern Details:
Name: Nitesh Verma (Cyber Nitesh)
Field of Study: Cyber Security & Ethical Hacking
Academic Background: Bachelor of Computer Applications (Final Year)
Mode of Internship: Virtual, Structured Tasks Based
Duration: January 2026
Security Interests: Web Application Security, OSINT, Ethical Hacking, Reconnaissance, Information Security, Red Teaming, Reporting

Internship Objective:
The primary objective of the internship was to engage in hands-on cybersecurity learning, apply security tools in controlled scenarios, understand reconnaissance and vulnerability analysis processes, interpret tool outputs, and structure findings into clear, evidence-based documentation. The internship emphasized responsible and ethical security assessment aligned with industry standards and educational development.

Task Breakdown:

Task-1: Web Vulnerability Testing
The first task focused on testing an intentionally vulnerable web application environment using a combination of manual payloads and security tools. SQL Injection behavior was tested manually and validated through automated exploitation frameworks. HTTP headers, server information, and software exposure were also analyzed to understand misconfigurations and weaknesses.

Task-2: Reconnaissance and OSINT Based Enumeration
The second task focused on passive reconnaissance and OSINT-based analysis of a target domain. This included domain ownership inspection, DNS record analysis, SSL certificate investigation, header inspection, redirection behavior analysis, and enumeration of subdomains. This task helped develop an understanding of how reconnaissance informs exploitation and attack surface mapping in real-world scenarios.

Task-3: Final Documentation and Reporting
The third task consolidated the research, findings, screenshots, methodology, and outcomes of Task-1 and Task-2 into a structured internship report. This reinforces the importance of reporting in cybersecurity, where communication and documentation play as significant a role as technical execution.

Repository Structure:
A modular folder-based structure was used for clarity and evaluation transparency:

Tools and Technologies Utilized:
The internship involved working with multiple cybersecurity tools, each supporting a specific stage of assessment:

Reconnaissance and Enumeration Tools:
• whois (Domain ownership and registrar insight)
• dig / host / nslookup (DNS resolution and record mapping)
• subfinder (Passive subdomain enumeration)
• amass (Extended OSINT enumeration)

Web Testing and Vulnerability Analysis Tools:
• SQLMap (Automated SQLi exploitation)
• Nikto (Web vulnerability and misconfiguration scanning)
• WhatWeb (Technology fingerprinting and exposure mapping)

Protocol and Certificate Tools:
• curl (Header-based inspection and HTTP behavior assessment)
• openssl (Certificate analysis and TLS/SSL inspection)

Execution Environment:
The practical tasks were executed primarily using Kali Linux, leveraging command-line based tooling and cybersecurity utilities. Screenshots, outputs, and results were captured and archived for documentation and verification.

Professional Learning Outcomes:
Completion of the internship tasks contributed to both technical and academic development in the following areas:

• Understanding web security vulnerability workflows
• SQL Injection testing and validation using manual and automated techniques
• Reconnaissance methodologies and passive information gathering
• DNS inspection and certificate validation
• Header analysis and security control evaluation
• Interpretation of security tool outputs into readable reports
• Documentation culture used in professional cybersecurity assessments
• Ethical boundaries and responsible testing practices
• Portfolio-style technical organization using GitHub

Reporting and Documentation Approach:
All tasks and outputs were documented in a structured manner consistent with common cybersecurity reporting methodology:
1) Objective
2) Scope Definition
3) Method of Testing
4) Tools Utilized
5) Execution Process
6) Findings and Observations
7) Evidence and Screenshots
8) Learning Reflection

Final Report:
A consolidated and submission-ready report summarizing all internship tasks and learning outcomes is provided within the repository at:
Task-3_Summary/Final_Report.pdf

Portfolio Purpose of Repository:
In addition to internship submission, this repository serves as a cybersecurity portfolio artifact and demonstrates ability in:
• Tool-based execution
• Structured knowledge recording
• Technical clarity and communication
• Evidence-based reporting
• Ethical cybersecurity practices

Ethical and Legal Note:
All security testing shown within this repository was executed on intentional test environments or publicly safe targets designed for educational and research use. No unauthorized testing or exploitation of real-world systems took place. Ethical cybersecurity practices were strictly adhered to at all times.

Submission Status:
Internship tasks completed and organized for evaluation under the Future Interns Cyber Security Internship Program. Repository submitted for review and verification.
