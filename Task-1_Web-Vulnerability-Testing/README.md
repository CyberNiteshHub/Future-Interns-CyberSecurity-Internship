Task-1 — Web Vulnerability Testing (Manual + Automated Assessment)

Objective:
The aim of this task was to identify web security vulnerabilities using a combination of manual payload testing and automated scanning methodologies. The testing was performed on a deliberately vulnerable web application for educational and internship purposes only.

Target Application:
http://testphp.vulnweb.com/

Tools Utilized:
• WhatWeb
• Nikto
• SQLMap
• Browser-based manual payload testing
• cURL

Testing Procedure:

1) Technology Fingerprinting
Tool Used: WhatWeb
Purpose:
To identify backend technologies, frameworks, server types, and programming languages used by the web application.

2) HTTP Header & Server Enumeration
Tool Used: curl -I
Purpose:
To examine server response headers, server information exposure, PHP version disclosure, and missing security headers such as X-Frame-Options and X-Content-Type-Options.

3) Automated Vulnerability Scanning
Tool Used: Nikto
Purpose:
To detect common server misconfigurations, insecure HTTP headers, deprecated components, and technology disclosures.
Key Observations:
• Security headers missing
• Software components disclosed
• Version exposure detected

4) SQL Injection (Automated Testing)
Tool Used: SQLMap
Parameter Tested: cat
Vulnerability Confirmed:
• Boolean-based SQL Injection
• Error-based SQL Injection
• Time-based SQL Injection
• UNION-based SQL Injection

Database enumerated through SQLMap:
• acuart
• information_schema

5) Manual Payload-Based SQL Injection Testing
Payloads used during manual testing:
'
OR 1=1
cat=%27
<script>alert(1)</script>

Observations:
• Error messages confirmed SQL injection behavior
• Input reflection observed on the parameterized URL
• Payload-based tampering altered application output

Findings Summary:
• SQL Injection vulnerability confirmed on parameter `cat`
• Server and version details disclosed
• Multiple security headers missing
• Input reflection behavior observed
• Technology & software components exposed

Assessment Table:

Vulnerability Detected        Status        Method Used
SQL Injection                 Confirmed     Manual + SQLMap
Security Header Issues        Confirmed     cURL + Nikto
Server Info Disclosure        Confirmed     WhatWeb + cURL
XSS Reflection Behavior       Partial       Manual Payloads


Key Takeaways:
• Combining manual and automated approaches significantly improves coverage
• Header misconfigurations can lead to exploitation and information leakage
• SQL Injection remains one of the most impactful vulnerabilities
• Proper input validation and query sanitization are essential for security

Conclusion:
The assessment confirmed that the target web application contains exploitable SQL Injection vulnerabilities and lacks essential security hardening controls. Missing security headers and server information disclosure increase the attack surface. Proper fixes should include parameterized queries, strict input validation, and hardened server configurations.
